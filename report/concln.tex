Basic GFW results were repeated.
A preliminary probe for GC-like activity was conducted.
A test in a controlled environment where I initiate file injections myself confirms that the probe works as intended.
Some more analysis on the data recorded after probing the partial file list from the DFO full-site crawl is needed.
It is still not clear how to use this method to probe for anything other than GC-like activity, but a persistent scan could be interesting.
