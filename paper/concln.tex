Basic GFW results were repeated.
A preliminary probe for GC-like activity was conducted.
So far, the probe appears to work as intended.
Some more analysis on the data recorded after probing the partial file list from the DFO full-site crawl is needed.
It is still not clear how to use this method to probe for anything other than GC-like activity.
