abstract = {The text of this paper has passed across many Internet routers on its way to the reader, but some routers will not pass it along unfettered because of censored words it contains. We present two sets of results: 1) Internet measurements of keyword filtering by the Great Firewall of China (GFC); and 2) initial results of using latent semantic analysis as an efficient way to reproduce a blacklist of censored words via probing. Our Internet measurements suggest that the GFCs keyword filtering is more a panopticon than a firewall, i.e., it need not block every illicit word, but only enough to promote self-censorship. Chinas largest ISP, ChinaNET, performed 83.3 \% of all filtering of our probes, and 99.1 \% of all filtering that occurred at the first hop past the Chinese border. Filtering occurred beyond the third hop for 11.8 \% of our probes, and there were sometimes as many as 13 hops past the border to a filtering router. Approximately 28.3\% of the Chinese hosts we sent probes to were reachable along paths that were not filtered at all. While more tests are needed to provide a definitive picture of the GFCs implementation, our results disprove the notion that GFC keyword filtering is a firewall strictly at the border of Chinas Internet. While evading a firewall a single time defeats its purpose, it would be necessary to evade a panopticon almost every time. Thus, in lieu of evasion, we propose ConceptDoppler, an architecture},

@article{Reis2008,
abstract = {While web pages sent over HTTP have no integrity guarantees, it is commonly assumed that such pages are not modified in transit. In this paper, we provide evidence of surprisingly widespread and diverse changes made to web pages between the server and client. Over 1\% of web clients in our study received altered pages, and we show that these changes often have undesirable consequences for web publishers or end users. Such changes include popup blocking scripts inserted by client software, advertisements injected by ISPs, and even malicious code likely inserted by malware using ARP poisoning. Additionally, we find that changes introduced by client software can inadvertently cause harm, such as introducing cross-site scripting vulnerabilities into most pages a client visits. To help publishers understand and react appropriately to such changes, we introduce web tripwires-client-side JavaScript code that can detect most in-flight modifications to a web page. We discuss several web tripwire designs intended to provide basic integrity checks for web servers. We show that they are more flexible and less expensive than switching to HTTPS and do not require changes to current browsers.},

abstract = {VPN Gate is a public VPN relay service designed to achieve blocking resistance to censorship firewalls such as the Great Firewall (GFW) of China. To achieve such resistance, we organize many volunteers to provide a VPN relay service, with many changing IP addresses. To block VPN Gate with their firewalls, censorship authorities must find the IP addresses of all the volunteers. To prevent this, we adopted two techniques to improve blocking resistance. The first technique is to mix a number of innocent IP addresses into the relay server list provided to the public. The second technique is collaborative spy detection. The volunteer servers work together to create a list of spies, meaning the computers used by censorship authorities to probe the volunteer servers. Using this list, each volunteer server ignores packets from spies. We launched VPN Gate on March 8, 2013. By the end of August it had about 3,000 daily volunteers using 6,300 unique IP addresses to facilitate 464,000 VPN connections from users worldwide, including 45,000 connections and 9,000 unique IP addresses from China. At the time VPN Gate maintained about 70\% of volunteer VPN servers as unblocked by the GFW.},
